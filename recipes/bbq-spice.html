    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This is a simple BBQ spice rub that can be used for pretty much any meat that you want to add a nice spiced, sweet flavour too.
             I personally like to use this on pork, and it is my go to spice rub for the <a href="./pulled-pork.html">pulled pork</a> recpie I have put on this website.</p>

        <P>When I'm looking for a BBQ spice recipe, I like to keep it fairyly simple, not to hot either, I want to taste the meat and the spice, not lose my sense of taste all together.
             I will make a quick disclaimer though, that this specific recipe has an additional ingredient from the original recipe, and that is mustard powder.
             I add it because it gives a little extra spice but not heat and little more complexity to the mix, also mustard powder just goes really well with pork.</P>

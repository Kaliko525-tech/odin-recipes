This is my first foundational project from TOP to create a recipe website. I will be using just basic HTML for now with emphasis on writing clean code and formating it correctly. With revisions coming in later to add other languages, such as CSS and JS. 

For now the task is simple. Create a recipe website with just HTML. 

so from the top:

1. home page. which will have an unordered list with links to each recipe. 
2. recipes pages, in a seperate directory, with the recipe as its name. add an H1 heading, then link the page back to the index. 

3. flesh out the recipe page, by adding an image(with description), and under the image, add a h2 "description" heading, then 1 or 2 paragraphs describing the recipe, followed by a "ingredients heading" with an unordered list, and last a "steps" heading with an ordered list on how to make the recipe. 

* repeat step 3 two more times.
